# Meet Christo: Code Monkey Extraordinaire

## A little background
Ever since I started taking computer science classes in high school and got my first computer: a sweet, _**suweet**_ Commodore 64...   

---wait, hold up - a Commo-_**what**_?  Dude how old _**are**_ you?---    

... uh, nevermind man, why don't you just keep reading and focus on the important stuff: code monkeys?

As I was saying, I have been geeking out over coding ever since my first introduction to software engineering in high school.  And I have been blessed with a career that allows me pursue this passion.  Even though some jobs weren't as glamerous as the movies would have you believe, I get to do some amazing things and be part of some amazing teams, and mostly get to use cutting edge tools in this crazy industry where the only constant is CHANGE!  

## A Hiatus
A little less than 2 years ago, word started spreading through the office that the winds of change are blowing and we might not be able to keep our current contract with the Air Force for much longer.  

Well, thank you very much for the warning!  I got out before that ship went down. Talked to a buddy from way back that had an "in" at PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers), and got myself a job there as a DevOps engineer.

And while I don't want to sound ungrateful (the pay is stupendous, and it is kinda cool working for a Fortune 500 company), after just shy of 2 years doing this gig I am sick of it.  I mean doing deployment pipelines and vault secrets and all that jazz is okay, but it just ain't CODING.  

## Returning to the Fold
I miss coding and developing software so bad, that I decided to draw a big fat line in the sand and come hell or high water, I am done pretending to be something that I am not.  I am done with this job.  I _**will**_ return to being a software engineer / web developer.  Soon.

## What's next?
I just applied for a senior software position at <a href="https://www.beast-code.com/" target="_blank">Beast Code</a>.  If you've never heard of them, click the link and go check them out.  It's okay, I'll wait for you...  Do you see what I mean?  Looks like a kick-ass company, right?  I am super excited about the prospect of landing a job at Beast Code.  The fact that their office is 5 minutes from my house doesn't hurt!

Anyway, I will attend a job fair and interview with them the first week in August.  God willing, I will be back doing what I love in the very near future.

## This Blog looks cool AF, how did you do it?
Believe it or not, this is a Vue app.  I am trying to learn this new to me framework and signed up for a <a href="https://www.vuemastery.com/" target="_blank">VueMastery</a> subscription.  They have a pretty cool course that covers some riveting content (Nuxt 3, Nuxt Content v2, Bulma CSS) that teaches you to build a blog.  Couple that with the free hosting for individuals that <a href="https://render.com" target="_blank">Render</a> provides and there you go: instant blog that will hopefully morph into a more fully featured portfolio over time.
