# So what to you think of Vue?

## What I Like
It seems lightweight.  Smaller bundles than Angular.  Faster to load in browser.  Faster to learn.  Will be good for prototyping.

Most of the core concepts are very similar to Angular (bindings, components, services, routing, state management, etc.).  If you are already familiar with Angular, learning Vue is a Breeze.

## What I am Unsure About
Is it really faster to develop with than Angular?  Not sure, I will need more experience with it.  I am sure that I am biased because I have used Angular for a long time...

It seems like it still has growing pains?  Like when we moved from AngularJs to Angular.  Hopefully none of those breaking changes in Vue's future.

Too soon to tell, but at first glance it seems like Angular has a better ecosystem than Vue.  Probably not the end of the world, it seems like what is there for Vue is pretty good.  But more choice is usually a good thing.

## What I don't Like
Single file components.  Why?  I mean is it really that hard to do separate files.  Separate html files especially.  In my experience the intellisense, and other baked in features of Code just work better in a dedicated html file.  The extension that does html highlighting in Vue SFCs works okay, but certainly not as smooth or fully featured.

I would like to see better Typescript integration.  No class support at this time?  Almost seems like an afterthought.  I still prefer Angular that was designed around Typescript.

Keep in my mind that I have all of 2 weekends playing with Vue.  Barely scratched the surface.  I am eager to spend more time with Vue (and I wouldn't mind learning React).  

That said, I'm not sure this will dethrone Angular as my favorite frontend framework.
Probably because I am highly opinionated, just like Angular.  Ba dum tsss!
